<!--The while Loop

The example below first sets a variable $i to one ($i = 1). 
Then, the while loop runs as long as $i is less than seven ($i < 7). 
$i will increase by one each time the loop runs ($i++): -->

<?php
    $i = 1;
    while ($i < 7) {
        echo "The value is $i <br />";
        $i++;
    }
?>
