<!--Loops

When writing code, you may want the same block of code to run over and over again. 
Instead of adding several almost equal code-lines in a script, we can use loops to perform a task like this.

The while Loop

The while loop executes a block of code as long as the specified condition is true.
Syntax: while (condition is true) {
   code to be executed;
}

If the condition never becomes false, the statement will continue to execute indefinitely.
The while Loop

The example below first sets a variable $i to one ($i = 1). 
Then, the while loop runs as long as $i is less than seven ($i < 7). 
$i will increase by one each time the loop runs ($i++): -->
<?php
    $i = 1;
    while ($i < 7) {
        echo "The value is $i <br />";
        $i++;
    }
?>
