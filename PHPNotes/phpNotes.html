<!--                           Control Structures
								


							 Conditional Statements

Conditional statements perform different actions for different decisions.
The if else statement is used to execute a certain code if a condition is true, and another code if the condition is false.
Syntax:if (condition) {
   code to be executed if condition is true;
} else {
   code to be executed if condition is false;
}
You can also use the if statement without the else statement, if you do not need to do anything, in case the condition is false.

									If Else

The example below will output the greatest number of the two.-->

<?php
$x = 10;
$y = 20;
if ($x >= $y) {
   echo $x;
} else {
   echo $y;
}

// Outputs "20"
?>

<!-- 
								The Elseif Statement

Use the if...elseif...else statement to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false.

Syntax: if (condition) {
  code to be executed if condition is true;
} elseif (condition) {
  code to be executed if condition is true;
} else {
   code to be executed if condition is false;
}
You can add as many elseif statements as you want. Just note, that the elseif statement must begin with an if statement.-->

<?php
$age = 21;

if ($age<=13) {
   echo "Child.";
} elseif ($age>13 && $age<19) {
   echo "Teenager";
} else {
   echo "Adult";
}
//Outputs "Adult"
?>
<!--
We used the logical AND (&&) operator to combine the two conditions and check to determine whether $age is between 13 and 19.
The curly braces can be omitted if there only one statement after the if/elseif/else. 
For example:-->

<?php
if($age<=13)
echo "Child";
else
echo "Adult";
?>


<!-- 
									Loops

When writing code, you may want the same block of code to run over and over again. 
Instead of adding several almost equal code-lines in a script, we can use loops to perform a task like this.

The while Loop

The while loop executes a block of code as long as the specified condition is true.
Syntax: while (condition is true) {
   code to be executed;
}

If the condition never becomes false, the statement will continue to execute indefinitely.
The while Loop

The example below first sets a variable $i to one ($i = 1). 
Then, the while loop runs as long as $i is less than seven ($i < 7). 
$i will increase by one each time the loop runs ($i++): -->
<?php
    $i = 1;
    while ($i < 7) {
        echo "The value is $i <br />";
        $i++;
    }
?>


<!--
								The do...while Loop

The do...while loop will always execute the block of code once, check the condition, and repeat the loop as long as the specified condition is true.

Syntax: do {
  code to be executed;
} while (condition is true); 

Regardless of whether the condition is true or false, the code will be executed at least once, which could be needed in some situations.

The do...while Loop

The example below will write some output, and then increment the variable $i by one. Then the condition is checked, and the loop continues to run, as long as $i is less than or equal to 7. -->
<?php

$i = 5;
do {
   echo "The number is " . $i . "<br/>";
   $i++;
} while($i <= 7);
//Output
//The number is 5
//The number is 6
//The number is 7
?>

<!--Note that in a do while loop, the condition is tested AFTER executing the statements within the loop. This means that the do while loop would execute its statements at least once, even if the condition is false the first time. -->

<!-- 
                                                         The for Loop

The for loop is used when you know in advance how many times the script should run.
 for (init; test; increment) {
   code to be executed;
}

Parameters:
init: Initialize the loop counter value
test: Evaluates each time the loop is iterated, continuing if evaluates to true, and ending if it evaluates to false
increment: Increases the loop counter value

Each of the parameter expressions can be empty or contain multiple expressions that are separated with commas.
In the for statement, the parameters are separated with semicolons.

The example below displays the numbers from 0 to 5:
Value of a : 0
Value of a : 1
Value of a : 2
Value of a : 3
Value of a : 4
Value of a : 5  -->
<?php
for ($a = 0; $a < 6; $a++) {
   echo "Value of a : ". $a . "<br />";
}
?>
