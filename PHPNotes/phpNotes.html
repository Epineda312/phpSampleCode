<!--                           Control Structures
								


							 Conditional Statements

Conditional statements perform different actions for different decisions.
The if else statement is used to execute a certain code if a condition is true, and another code if the condition is false.
Syntax:if (condition) {
   code to be executed if condition is true;
} else {
   code to be executed if condition is false;
}
You can also use the if statement without the else statement, if you do not need to do anything, in case the condition is false.

									If Else

The example below will output the greatest number of the two.-->

<?php
$x = 10;
$y = 20;
if ($x >= $y) {
   echo $x;
} else {
   echo $y;
}

// Outputs "20"
?>

<!-- 
								The Elseif Statement

Use the if...elseif...else statement to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false.

Syntax: if (condition) {
  code to be executed if condition is true;
} elseif (condition) {
  code to be executed if condition is true;
} else {
   code to be executed if condition is false;
}
You can add as many elseif statements as you want. Just note, that the elseif statement must begin with an if statement.-->

<?php
$age = 21;

if ($age<=13) {
   echo "Child.";
} elseif ($age>13 && $age<19) {
   echo "Teenager";
} else {
   echo "Adult";
}
//Outputs "Adult"
?>
<!--
We used the logical AND (&&) operator to combine the two conditions and check to determine whether $age is between 13 and 19.
The curly braces can be omitted if there only one statement after the if/elseif/else. 
For example:-->

<?php
if($age<=13)
echo "Child";
else
echo "Adult";
?>


<!-- 
									Loops

When writing code, you may want the same block of code to run over and over again. 
Instead of adding several almost equal code-lines in a script, we can use loops to perform a task like this.

The while Loop

The while loop executes a block of code as long as the specified condition is true.
Syntax: while (condition is true) {
   code to be executed;
}

If the condition never becomes false, the statement will continue to execute indefinitely.
The while Loop

The example below first sets a variable $i to one ($i = 1). 
Then, the while loop runs as long as $i is less than seven ($i < 7). 
$i will increase by one each time the loop runs ($i++): -->
<?php
    $i = 1;
    while ($i < 7) {
        echo "The value is $i <br />";
        $i++;
    }
?>


<!--
								The do...while Loop

The do...while loop will always execute the block of code once, check the condition, and repeat the loop as long as the specified condition is true.

Syntax: do {
  code to be executed;
} while (condition is true); 

Regardless of whether the condition is true or false, the code will be executed at least once, which could be needed in some situations.

The do...while Loop

The example below will write some output, and then increment the variable $i by one. Then the condition is checked, and the loop continues to run, as long as $i is less than or equal to 7. -->
<?php

$i = 5;
do {
   echo "The number is " . $i . "<br/>";
   $i++;
} while($i <= 7);
//Output
//The number is 5
//The number is 6
//The number is 7
?>

<!--Note that in a do while loop, the condition is tested AFTER executing the statements within the loop. This means that the do while loop would execute its statements at least once, even if the condition is false the first time. -->

<!-- 
                                                         The for Loop

The for loop is used when you know in advance how many times the script should run.
 for (init; test; increment) {
   code to be executed;
}

Parameters:
init: Initialize the loop counter value
test: Evaluates each time the loop is iterated, continuing if evaluates to true, and ending if it evaluates to false
increment: Increases the loop counter value

Each of the parameter expressions can be empty or contain multiple expressions that are separated with commas.
In the for statement, the parameters are separated with semicolons.

The example below displays the numbers from 0 to 5:
Value of a : 0
Value of a : 1
Value of a : 2
Value of a : 3
Value of a : 4
Value of a : 5  -->
<?php
for ($a = 0; $a < 6; $a++) {
   echo "Value of a : ". $a . "<br />";
}
?>
<!-- 
                    The foreach Loop

The foreach loop works only on arrays, and is used to loop through each key/value pair in an array.

There are two syntaxes: foreach (array as $value) {
  code to be executed;
}
//or
foreach (array as $key => $value) {
   code to be executed;
}
The first form loops over the array. 
On each iteration, the value of the current element is assigned to $value, and the array pointer is moved by one, until it reaches the last array element.
The second form will additionally assign the current element's key to the $key variable on each iteration.

The following example demonstrates a loop that outputs the values of the $names array. -->
<?php
$names = array("John", "David", "Amy");
foreach ($names as $name) {
   echo $name.'<br />';
}
?>
<!--
// John
// David
// Amy
-->

<!-- The switch Statement

The switch statement is an alternative to the if-elseif-else statement.
Use the switch statement to select one of a number of blocks of code to be executed.
-->
<?php
Syntax: switch (n) {
  case value1:
    //code to be executed if n=value1
    break;
  case value2:
     //code to be executed if n=value2
     break;
  ...
  default:
    // code to be executed if n is different from all labels
}
?>
<!--First, our single expression, n (most often a variable), is evaluated once.
Next, the value of the expression is compared with the value of each case in the structure. 
If there is a match, the block of code associated with that case is executed.
Using nested if else statements results in similar behavior, but switch offers a more elegant and optimal solution.
Switch

Consider the following example, which displays the appropriate message for each day. -->
<?php
$today = 'Tue';

switch ($today) {
  case "Mon":
    echo "Today is Monday.";
    break;
  case "Tue":
    echo "Today is Tuesday.";
    break;
  case "Wed":
    echo "Today is Wednesday.";
    break;
  case "Thu":
    echo "Today is Thursday.";
    break;
  case "Fri":
     echo "Today is Friday.";
     break;
  case "Sat":
     echo "Today is Saturday.";
     break;
  case "Sun":
     echo "Today is Sunday.";
     break;
  default:
     echo "Invalid day.";
}
?>
<!--
//Outputs "Today is Tuesday."
Try It Yourself

The break keyword that follows each case is used to keep the code from automatically running into the next case. 
If you forget the break; statement, PHP will automatically continue through the next case statements, even when the case doesn't match.

            default

The default statement is used if no match is found.
-->
<?php
$x=5;
switch ($x) {
  case 1:
    echo "One";
    break;
  case 2:
    echo "Two";
    break;
  default:
    echo "No match";
}
?>
<!--
//Outputs "No match"
Try It Yourself

The default statement is optional, so it can be omitted.
-->

<!-- 
  The break Statement

As discussed in the previous lesson, the break statement is used to break out of the switch when a case is matched.
If the break is absent, the code keeps running. For example: -->
<?php
$x=1;
switch ($x) {
  case 1:
    echo "One";
  case 2:
    echo "Two";
  case 3:
    echo "Three";
  default:
    echo "No match";
}
?>
<!--
//Outputs "OneTwoThreeNo match"


Break can also be used to halt the execution of for, foreach, while, do-while structures.
The break statement ends the current for, foreach, while, do-while or switch and continues to run the program on the line coming up after the loop.
A break statement in the outer part of a program (e.g., not in a control loop) will stop the script. 
-->

<!-- 
  The continue Statement

When used within a looping structure, the continue statement allows for skipping over what remains of the current loop iteration. It then continues the execution at the condition evaluation and moves on to the beginning of the next iteration.

The following example skips the even numbers in the for loop: -->
<?php
for ($i=0; $i<10; $i++) {
  if ($i%2==0) {
    continue;
  }
  echo $i . ' ';
}

//Output: 1 3 5 7 9
?>

<!--
You can use the continue statement with all looping structures.

-->

<!-- 
  include

The include and require statements allow for the insertion of the content of one PHP file into another PHP file, before the server executes it.
Including files saves quite a bit of work. You can create a standard header, footer, or menu file for all of your web pages. Then, when the header is requiring updating, you can update the header include file only.

Assume that we have a standard header file called header.php. <?php
  echo '<h1>Welcome</h1>';
?>
Use the include statement to include the header file in a page.<html>
  <body>

  <?php include 'header.php'; ?>

  <p>Some text.</p>
  <p>Some text.</p>
  </body>
</html>

include

Using this approach, we have the ability to include the same header.php file into multiple pages.<html>
  <body>

  <?php include 'header.php'; ?>

  <p>This is a paragraph</p>
  </body>
</html>
include vs require

The require statement is identical to include, the exception being that, upon failure, it produces a fatal error.
When a file is included using the include statement, but PHP is unable to find it, the script continues to execute.
In the case of require, the script will cease execution and produce an error.
Use require when the file is required for the application to run.
Use include when the file is not required. The application should continue, even when the file is not found.
